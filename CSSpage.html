			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<div class = "whole">

				<p>CSS styles standard HTML. It is a way of separating the styling from the actual content. It provides a single point of control of stylistic changes for entire elements large and small. For instance, you can style the color of the entire page or just one small paragraph element. CSS is basically is a list of styling rules. </p>

			<h2>Selectors</h2>
			</br>
			<div class = "half">	
			<p>
				A rule specifies the location to style and then the style to use. The syntax is shown to the right.

					</br>

				You can also combine multiple selectors into one. This is useful if you wanted to style multiple elements the same way, so you don't have to repeat code.

			<h2>Adding stylesheets</h2>

			<div class = "half">
				<p>

					</br>

					An external styesheet is the preferred way since the point of CSS is to seperate style for the content, so having a seperate page is the best way of achieving this. You can reference the stylesheet in the head element of a page.
