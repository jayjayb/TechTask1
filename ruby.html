			<p>So how is Ruby different from Java? First off in Java you must compile your code before you can run it. However in Ruby you just run it directly. Another main difference is that in Ruby everything is an object, even things like simple numbers. One more big difference is that variables are dynamicly casted. We will get into more of what this means below.</p>

			<p>Ruby comes with a very useful program that can show the results of Ruby statements as you feed them to the program in a terminal. In order to access this in the Unix environment open a terminal and type in "irb" then hit enter. You will then see something similar to what you see in example 1 on the right. Using irb is a very good way to learn how the basics of many Ruby. To exit the irb simply type exit and press enter.

		<div class = "half" id = "code">
			<p>Example 1</p>
			<code>/home/4/cseUsername<br>
				% irb<br>
				irb(main):001:0> exit<br>
				/home/4/cseUsername<br>
				% 
			</code>
		</div>

			Another way of writing Ruby code is to have it in a file with the .rb extension. For this tutorial an easy way to test the code you see is to make a file and copy code into it and then run that file. An example of executing a ruby file can be seen in example 2.
