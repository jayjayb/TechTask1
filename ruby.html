		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<div class = "whole">

			<p>Ruby is popular general-purpose, object-oriented programming langauge. Although its general-purpose nature allows it to be used for many different things, most developers use it as a server-side programming langauge for desiging web applications. </p>
			</br>
			<p>So how is Ruby different from Java? First off in Java you must compile your code before you can run it. Ruby, However, is known as an interpreted langauge, so everything is determined at runtime, and no compilation is necessary. Also, everything in ruby is an object, even things like integers and characters. Building off of this, there are no static 'types' in ruby like Java has. Rather, everything is dynamically typed, so the type of a variable can change during runtime. Many of the useful and different features Ruby provides will be discussed on this page. </p>

		<h2>Control Flow in Ruby</h2>

		<div class = "whole">
		<p>Control flow allows for directing what code executes in a program.One can use things like if/else or switch statements to direct the flow of a program, similar to that of Java.</p>
