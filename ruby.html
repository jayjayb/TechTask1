		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<div class = "whole">

			<p>Ruby is popular general-purpose, object-oriented programming langauge. Although its general-purpose nature allows it to be used for many different things, most developers use it as a server-side programming langauge for desiging web applications. </p>
			</br>
			<p>So how is Ruby different from Java? First off in Java you must compile your code before you can run it. Ruby, However, is known as an interpreted langauge, so everything is determined at runtime, and no compilation is necessary. Also, everything in ruby is an object, even things like integers and characters. Building off of this, there are no static 'types' in ruby like Java has. Rather, everything is dynamically typed, so the type of a variable can change during runtime. Many of the useful and different features Ruby provides will be discussed on this page. </p>

		<h2>Let's Begin</h2>

		<div class = "half">
			<p>Ruby comes with a very useful program that can show the results of Ruby statements as you feed them to the program in a terminal. In order to access this in the Unix environment open a terminal and type in "irb" then hit enter. You will then see something similar to what you see in example 1 on the right. Using irb is a very good way to learn how the basics of many Ruby. To exit the irb simply type exit and press enter.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "half" id = "code">
			<p>Example 1</p>
			<code>/home/4/cseUsername<br>
				% irb<br>
				irb(main):001:0> exit<br>
				/home/4/cseUsername<br>
				% 
			</code>
		</div>
	</div>

			Another way of writing Ruby code is to have it in a file with the .rb extension. For this tutorial an easy way to test the code you see is to make a file and copy code into it and then run that file. An example of executing a ruby file can be seen in example 2.
			</p>

		<div class = "half" id = "code">
			<p>Example 2
			</p>
			<code>/home/4/cseUsername<br>
				% ruby exampleFile.rb<br>
				/home/4/cseUsername<br>
				% 
			</code>

		<h2>Control Flow in Ruby</h2>

		<div class = "whole">
		<p>Control flow allows for directing what code executes in a program.One can use things like if/else or switch statements to direct the flow of a program, similar to that of Java.</p>
		</div>

		</br>
		
		<div class = "half">
			<p>Let's start by using ruby to do a simple "Hello world" program.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "half" id = "code">
			<p class = "code">asdf</p>
			<code>Hello world</code>
		</div>
