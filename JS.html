<h3 id="first-hello-world-using-javascript">First Hello World Using Javascript</h3>

<p>Let's start our first hello world program use inlining.</p>

<p>let's have a plain HTML page ready. Also open the file in a browser.</p>

<p>Javascript could be embeded into the HTML page(Inline). Save the file.</p>

<p>Refresh the HTML page on browser. Did you see that "Hello World" is  now shown in the HTML page.</p>

<p>Congragulations, you've just finished the first Hello World!</p>

<h3 id="second-hello-world-using-javascript">Second Hello World Using Javascript</h3>
<p>Let's start our second hello world program using external Javascript file.</p>

<p>let's have a plain HTML page ready just like before. Also open the file in a browser.</p>

<p>Javascript can be put in an exteral file and We can link to the Javascript file by doing the following.</p>

<p>Create a seperate javascript file in the same directory, call it "javascript.js" as you see in the above picture. 
within the javascript.js, put the following code:</p>

<p>window.alert("Hello World! ");</p>

<p>This will create a pop up window every time the page is loaded.</p>
