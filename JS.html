<h3 id="what-is-javascript">What is Javascript</h3>

<p>Javascript is a scripting language that add behavior to a website. websites with only HTML and CSS are static, meaning that the webpage is does not change much. With the help of Javascript, one can create dynamic web page that its content could change after it is rendered.</p>

<h3 id="javascript-concept">Javascript Concept</h3>
<p>Javascript is understood by most browsers. It is a scripting language that we can use to accomplish tasks on the client side. The following are some concepts about Javascript</p>

<ul>
  <li>Javascript work with HTML</li>
  <li>Javascript can be used to do some computation</li>
  <li>Javascript is dynamically typed(different from Java)</li>
  <li>Javascript is object based, it uses DOM(Document Object Model)</li>
  <li>Javascript can be used to handle events on HTML page</li>
</ul>

<p>Today we are going to learn to some basics about javascript. First, let's start writing Hello World using Javascript and understand where to put Javascript code (inline or external).</p>

<h3 id="first-hello-world-using-javascriptinline">First Hello World Using Javascript(Inline)</h3>

<p>Let's start our first hello world program use inlining.</p>

<p>let's have a plain HTML page ready. Also open the file in a browser.</p>

<img src = "img/PlainHTML.png"/ alt = "plain HTML picture"> 

<p>Javascript could be embedded into the HTML page(Inline). Save the file.</p>

<img src = "img/InlineJS.png"/ alt = "inline JS picture"> 

<p>Refresh the HTML page on browser. Did you see that "Hello World" is  now shown in the HTML page.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you've just finished the first Hello World!</p>

<h3 id="second-hello-world-using-javascriptlink-external-file">Second Hello World Using Javascript(Link External File)</h3>
<p>Let's start our second hello world program using external Javascript file.</p>

<p>let's have a plain HTML page ready just like before. Also open the file in a browser.</p>

<p>Javascript can be put in an external file and We can link to the Javascript file by doing the following.</p>

<img src = "img/ExternalJS.png"/ alt = "external JS picture"> 

<p>Create a separate javascript file in the same directory, call it "javascript.js" as you see in the above picture. 
within the javascript.js, put the following code:</p>

<p>window.alert("Hello World! ");</p>

<p>This will create a pop up window every time the page is loaded.</p>

<p>Let's see the result!(refresh the HTML page) If you see a pop up window with "Hello World", then you've accomplished this task.</p>

<h3 id="change-html-content">Change HTML Content</h3>
<p>Next, I would like to introduce the DOM(Document Object Model). The DOM is an javascript interface that allows us to access the HTML content.</p>

<p>Let's say we have the given plain HTML page like before. We would like to change the "This is a paragraph" to "I am using Javascript DOM!".</p>

<p>First Open the original HTML page in a browser. We want to compare how the content of HTML page is changed before and after javascript code. The "This is a paragraph" is part of the paragraph tag. We would like to access the paragraph tag and change its content through javascript DOM. First, we could like to assign an id to the paragraph tag. Then, we could access the the paragraph through the id. Like the following:</p>

<img src = "img/DOM.png"/ alt = "DOM picture"> 

<p>Then refresh the HTML page. Did you see that the content of the first paragraph tag just changed.</p>

<p>Congrats, you just learned how to use DOM to access HTML content.</p>

<h2>Arrays </h2>

<p>Array Declaration:</p>

<p>In Javascript, there are two main ways to declare arrays.</p>

<p>The Array Constructor:
 var example = new Array ();
var example = (“one”,”two”,”three”,”four”,”five”);
Array Literal Notation:
var example = [“one”,”two”,”three”,”four”];</p>
<p>Length:
	//using last array declared called example
	example.length; //equal to 4
	example.length == 4; //true</p>
<p>Arrays can are dynamically sized in javascript meaning they can shrink and grow after they are declared and defined.
	//adds 5 to end of the array; note: arrays can have elements of different types
	example[length] = 5; 
	example.length; //now length is 5
	//can grow arrays by adding new elements to an index that might be greater than length
example[9] = “the”; //example = [“one”,”two”,”three”,”four”, 5, , , “the”];</P>
<p>// can modify elements too
example[0] = 15; //example = [15,”two”,”three”,”four”, 5, , , “the”];</p>
<p>//can delete elements
delete example[1]; //changes example[1] from “two” to undefined</p>
<p>Can use built in methods to add:
//unlike java can add multiple elements at a time
var arrayarray = [1,2,3,4,5,6];</p>
arrayarray.push(7,8); //arrayarray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
<p>//can add elements to beginning as well as end
arrayarray.unshift(-1,0); //arrayarray = [-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];</p>
<p>Can use built in methods to remove elements:
	var start = arrayarray.shift(); //start = -1
	var end = arrayarray.pop(); //end = 8; arrayarray = [-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]</p>
<p>Can search for elements using indexOf/lastIndexOf
	returns -1 if it does not find an occurrence
	indexOf(element,startIndex);
	lastIndexOf(element,lastIndex);</p>
<p>Accessors that do not modify array, but result in new array
	Concatenate using concat:
		array3 = array1.concat(array2);
	Join on a separator (default is a comma):
		join(seperator)
	Extract a subsection using: splice
		slice(startIndex, endIndex);
		
		var datnewarray = [1,2,3];
		var spliced = datnewarray.slice(0,1) ; spliced = [1,2]</p>
<p>Sorting and reversing:
	arrayname.reverse(); //reverses arrayname
	var sevenseven = [“jon”, “jacob”, “joseph”, “nate”];
	//will put them in alphabetical order by default
	sevenseven.sort(); // sevenseven = [“jacob”, “jon”, “joseph”, “nate”];</p>



<h2>Functions:</h2>

	<p>Declaring a function is a similiar to java
		function addone (parameter1){
			parameter1+=1;
			return parameter1;
		}</p>
	<p>Calling a function is similar to java
		var y = 199;
		addone(parameter1);</p>
	<p>Unlike, java you do have to name functions
		function (parameter1, parameter2){...}; //this is valid</p>
	<p>Need to assign a no named function to a variable to access
		var tocall = function (parameter1, parameter2){...}; </p>
	<p>Any function can be assigned to variable, not just no named ones.</p>
	<p>Functions can be used as variables.
		var two = 27;
		addtwo = addone(z)+1;</p>
	<p>Functions can be arguments in other functions.</p>
	<p>Functions can be the return value of other functions.</p>
	<p>
	A function can be declared within another function (nested functions are allowed)
		function nested(a,b){
			function add{
				return a + b;
			}
			function addfive{
				return a +b + 5;
			}
				return add + addfive;

		}</p>
	<p>Like java, local variables (those created in the function) are only visible inside of the function. However, if an inner function is being returned, it is called a closure and its local variables are kept alive after the function has returned.</p>
<p>
Reduce will apply an operator between all elements of an array and uses a function as argument:
	var example = [4,5,6];
	var mult = example.reduce (function(a,b){
		return a*b
	}</p>
<p>Filter and Map work in the same way. They modify an array by taking a function as a parameter. Map will take an array and transform it into an new array according to the function passed as a parameter. Filter will filter the elements of an array according to the function passed as a parameter. Foreach will do modify each element of an array according to the parameter function passed in.
Sort can take a comparison function a parameter and then sort it according to that instead of the standard alphabetical order for strings.</p>
